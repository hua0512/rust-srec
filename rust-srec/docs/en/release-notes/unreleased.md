## Pipeline and uploads

- **Upload recordings to Baidu Netdisk**

  A new `baidupcs` pipeline processor uploads recordings to Baidu Netdisk through the BaiduPCS-Go command-line tool, which is now bundled in the Docker image. Add it to a pipeline like any other upload step: the destination folder supports the usual streamer/title/date placeholders, same-name files can be skipped or overwritten, and uploads appear in the same live progress, per-file records and streamer-card indicators as rclone transfers. Log in from the preset editor — paste your netdisk cookies (or BDUSS and STOKEN) once and the account card shows who is signed in and how much space is left. Tick **Remember for automatic re-login** and upload jobs log in again by themselves when the session expires, so a recording made at night still lands in the netdisk without anyone clicking Login; leave it unticked and the credentials are handed to BaiduPCS-Go without the app keeping them. If the remembered credentials themselves stop working, a notification tells you to log in again and further attempts pause for an hour instead of hammering Baidu. Logging out forgets the remembered credentials. Because BaiduPCS-Go's exit code does not reflect upload results, rust-srec reads the tool's per-file output instead, and a retried job re-sends only the files that did not make it.
